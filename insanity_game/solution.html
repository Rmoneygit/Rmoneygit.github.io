        <p class="message">This page contains a solution to the puzzle. Before checking it out, if you have not already solved the puzzle yourself,
            I would encourage you to keep trying and see if you can come up with it on your own. The act of solving it on your own will be a rewarding and satisfying experience.
            But I also understand how frustrating the puzzle can be. Keep in mind this is just one possible solution, there are others. Some of the moves in the solution could be
            performed in different orders, others cannot.
